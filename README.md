# 🧩 Project Summary  

This project demonstrates a **fully automated, end-to-end analytics and reporting platform** built on the Olist Brazilian E-commerce dataset:
- Raw CSV files are loaded into **Google BigQuery**, where **dbt (Data Build Tool)** manages a **modular, tested, and version-controlled transformation** layer of the ELT workflow — including **data modeling**, **testing**, **documentation**, and **analytics readiness**.
- On top of the dbt-produced marts, a **Python analytics package** performs deeper programmatic checks, anomaly detection, KPI calculations, and constructs a controlled prompt to generate **AI / LLM–driven narrative reports** (generated by **OpenAI** and **Google Gemini** using validated metrics only; no raw data exposure). Finally, the generated AI narrative is embedded into **Power BI** alongside interactive dashboards.

🔗 **Dataset:** The data is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce)

# 🏗️ Project Architecture
The key design principle of this project is **automation**: data cleaning, transformation, analytics, and report generation are fully automated, enabling fast regeneration of up-to-date dashboards and data-driven insights with minimal manual effort.

## ⚙️ Data Source Configuration  
The source datasets are defined in `_sources.yml`, referencing all raw tables located in the `rawdata` schema of the `olist-ecommerce-2025` dataset in **BigQuery**.

<p align="center"><i>Excerpt from `_sources.yml`</i></p>

``` yml
version: 2
sources:
  - name: olist_dataset
    description: "Raw tables from the Olist Brazilian E-Commerce Dataset"
    database: olist-ecommerce-2025
    schema: rawdata
    tables:
      - name: customers
        description: "Contains unique customer identifiers, their city, and state..."
      - name: geolocation
      ...
```

## 🧩 Modeling, Testing & Transformation Workflow  
In dbt, data transformation, testing, and documentation are tightly integrated rather than sequential. Each model, once created or updated, it is immediately tested and incorporated into the project's **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**. 

<p align="center"><i>DAG of Entire Project</i></p>
<p align="center">

### 🧱 Model Layers
#### Overview
- **Staging Layer** – Renaming column names, standardize datatypes, etc. 
- **Intermediate Layer** – Performs joins, aggregations, and logic transformations between staging and marts.
- **Marts Layer** – Produces analytics-ready tables for reporting and BI, including both **star schema** models and **standalone analytical models** such as RFM segmentation, seller performance, and delivery reliability.

A **seed** CSV enriches the models with full province names (linked by province abbreviation). Additionally, the `schema.sql` **macro** ensures schema naming consistency and automates dataset organization inside BigQuery. 

<p align="center"><i>`schema.sql`</i></p>

```
{% macro generate_schema_name(custom_schema_name, node) -%}
    {%- set default_schema = target.schema -%}
    {%- if custom_schema_name is none -%}
        {{ default_schema }}
    {%- else -%}
        {{ custom_schema_name | trim }}
    {%- endif -%}
{%- endmacro %}
```
#### A Look Into the Mart Layer
The marts layer contains both dimensional and analytical models:
- **Fact and Dimension Tables** – Form the basis of a star schema, including a `date` dimension table 
- **standalone BI specific models:** Designed to answer concrete business questions and support dashboards (e.g., RFM segmentation, cohort retention, seller reliability).

  
**_Example 1: RFM Segmentation Model_**

This model segments customers using the classic **Recency, Frequency, Monetary (RFM)** framework:
- **Metrics:**
  - Recency (R): Days since last purchase
  - Frequency (F): Number of purchases
  - Monetary (M): Total spent
- **Scope:** Last 12 months of transactions in the dataset are considered
- Combined RFM score determines customer segments (*Champions*, *Loyal Customers*,*Potential Loyalists*, *At Risk*, *Lost*)

🔗 **File:** [RFM Segmentation Model](https://github.com/Seyyed-Reza-Mashhadi/OLIST_Project/blob/master/dbt_olist/models/mart/BI_customer_rfm.sql)

**_Example 2: Cohort Analysis Model_**

This model groups customers into **cohorts** based on their **first purchase date** and tracks **customer retention rate** and spending across time periods. It evaluates both individual cohort performance and weighted averages to reveal overall customer lifecycle trends.

🔗 **File:** [Cohort Analysis Model](https://github.com/Seyyed-Reza-Mashhadi/OLIST_Project/blob/master/dbt_olist/models/mart/BI_customer_cohorts.sql)

## ✅ Integrated Data Testing
Testing occurs alongside model development — ensuring every transformation maintains data quality before it’s used downstream.
### 1️⃣ Generic Tests  
Generic tests ensure fundamental data integrity. Defining **unique** and **not_null** tests for primary keys is essential, while **relationships** tests validate foreign key references. For columns with a limited set of valid categorical values (e.g., `order_status`), **accepted_values** tests are applied to enforce consistency.

<p align="center"><i>Excerpt from `_staging.yml`</i></p>

```yml
version: 2
models:
- name: STG_order_payments
    description: "Order payment data with standardized data formats and column names."
    columns:
      - name: order_id
        description: "Order identifier key."
        tests:
          - not_null
          - relationships:
              arguments:
                to: ref('STG_orders')
                field: order_id
      - name: payment_value
        description: "Payment value for the order."
        tests:
          - not_null
          - not_negative
      - name: payment_type
        description: "Payment method used for the order."
        tests:
          - accepted_values:
              arguments:
                values: ['credit_card', 'boleto', 'voucher', 'debit_card', 'not_defined']
```

### 2️⃣ Custom Generic Test  
The `not_negative` test ensures that numeric columns (e.g., `price`, `payment_value`) never contain negative values. As a **custom generic test**, it is modular and reusable across multiple models and columns.

<p align="center"><i>`not_negative.sql`</i></p>

```sql
{% test not_negative(model, column_name) %}
    SELECT {{ column_name }}
    FROM {{model}}
    WHERE {{ column_name }} < 0
{% endtest %} 
```

### 3️⃣ Singular Tests – Business Logic & Cross-Table Validation  

We implemented domain-specific singular tests to ensure business logic and data consistency. These tests highlight how **dbt enables rule-based data validation** beyond basic null checks. 

#### Example 1: Coordinates validation

- **Logic:** longitude and latitude ranges should be logical  
- **Purpose:** Ensures data reliability for future BI illustrations in maps 
- **Severity:** ❌ `error` 
- **Result:** ~0 errors — good data quality  
 
<p align="center"><i>`coordinates_validation.sql`</i></p>

```sql
{{ config(store_failures = true) }} 
SELECT latitude, longitude
FROM {{ ref('STG_geolocation') }}
WHERE latitude < -90 OR latitude > 90 OR longitude < -180 OR longitude > 180
LIMIT 1000  -- Cap the materialization to avoid excessive data storing in case of widespread failures
```

#### Example 2: Payment consistency

- **Logic:** For delivered/shipped/invoiced orders, aggregated payments = item price + freight  
- **Purpose:** Ensures financial completeness & accuracy  
- **Tolerance:** ±0.05 (to avoid rounding noise)  
- **Severity:** ⚠️ `warn`
- **Result:** ~258 mismatches were detected. Logically, this test should have an `error` severity to fail the run, but due to known data quirks (e.g., installment interest, taxes, etc.), it was set to `warn` to allow the pipeline to continue while still flagging potential issues.

<p align="center"><i>`payment_test_1.sql`</i></p>

```sql 
{{ config(severity='warn', store_failures = true) }}  

SELECT 
    p.order_id,
    p.payment_value,
    (o.total_price + o.total_freight_value) AS expected_payment
FROM {{ ref('INT_order_payments_agg') }} as p
INNER JOIN {{ ref('INT_order_items_agg') }} as o 
    ON p.order_id = o.order_id
INNER JOIN {{ ref('STG_orders') }} as s
    ON p.order_id = s.order_id
WHERE 
    s.order_status IN ('delivered', 'shipped', 'invoiced')
    AND ABS(p.payment_value - (o.total_price + o.total_freight_value)) > 0.10 -- considering a small tolerance of 10 cents
LIMIT 1000  -- Cap the materialization to avoid excessive data storing in case of widespread failures
```

## ☁️ Deployment on dbt Cloud  

After completing and testing all dbt models locally using **dbt-core** in VS code, the project was deployed to **dbt Cloud**, connected directly to the GitHub repository for version control and continuous integration.

- Responsible AI / LLM practices by:
  - Grounded inputs: LLMs receive only validated JSON summaries and constructed context — never raw tables.
  - Strict prompt constraints: Prompts explicitly prohibit assumptions or hallucinations (e.g., “Do NOT hallucinate or assume data that is not present. Draw careful, logical interpretations grounded strictly in the provided data”
  - Determinism: Low temperature and structured prompts minimize randomness.
  - Auditability: All prompts, contexts, and AI outputs are saved to /outputs for traceability.
  - Outputs from OpenAI and Gemini are provided for coherence and factual consistency.

# 🧩 Conclusions

## 📌 General Remarks About The Project 

This project represents **a fully automated, end-to-end analytics solution** with dbt-controlled transformation, Python-based analytics, and AI-augmented reporting.

Firstly, the project highlights **dbt**’s strength as a **transformation framework**, enabling modular, tested, and transparent data pipelines. It demonstrates the complete transformation workflow — from staging and intermediate logic to analytical marts — emphasizing the “T” in ELT. Note that **freshness** and **incremental models** were not required here for this static dataset, but remain essential for real-time or production-level dbt projects. 

Secondly, the **Python layer** builds on dbt outputs to perform complex analytics such as anomaly detection, KPI calculations, and AI-driven narrative generation. The **LLM** layer interprets validated metrics to generate executive-ready insights embedded into Power BI. This enables fast, actionable interpretations of the data whenever dashboards are refreshed.

This design demonstrates how **analytics engineering, reproducible data science, and responsible AI/LLM usage** can be combined to deliver trustworthy, decision-ready insights.

## 📊 Data-driven Insights About OLIST Dataset 

The OLIST dataset reflects substantial operational scale with **$15.42 million in total revenue** across **96,477 orders** from **93,357 unique customers**, supported by **2,970 sellers**.  

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) – based only on delivered (completed) orders:**
- 💰 **Average Order Value (AOV):** $159.86  
- 🛒 **Average Basket Size:** 1.14 items  
- 💵 **Revenue per Customer:** $165.20  
- 📦 **Orders per Customer:** 1.03  
- 🏪 **Orders per Seller:** 32.48  

These metrics indicate a high average transaction value but a **predominantly single-purchase customer base**, as shown by the average orders per customer of just 1.03. This suggests **heavy reliance on new customer acquisition rather than repeat business**.  

Additional insights confirm this trend:  
- **Cohort Retention** and **RFM Segmentation** (visualized in Power BI) reveal strong acquisition but weak retention:  
  - **Fewer than 1% of customers** make a repeat purchase after their first month  
  - Only **~12.5% of customers** qualify as loyal or champion segments  
  - Most revenue comes from potential loyalists
